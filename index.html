				My name is Bryan Mocarski and I was born on March 12, 1998 at Northside Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. I have one older brother and one older sister. Atlanta has been home to me ever since I was born as I have lived in the same house all my life. I was blessed enough to grow up with a very supportive family and live in a friendly neighborhood. I went to Warren T. Jackson Elementary School through fourth grade and then Holy Spirit Preparatory School from fifth grade to senior year of high school.

			<P style="margin-left: 20px">Currently, I am a freshman at the University of Georgia, and I'm working to make my way into the Terry College of Business in the near future. I am a member of UGA Miracle, in which I help raise money for Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. In my free time, I love playing basketball as well as rooting on my favorite NFL team, which is the Green Bay Packers. The most important things in my life are my faith, my family, and my friends.
			</P>
			<P style="margin-left: 20px">From my experience at this university, I hope to leave with new relationships that last a lifetime as well as a readiness to go into the real world and make a difference by doing the things I love. I hope to one day start a family and pass on all the life lessons I have learned to my kids. Every day I try to be thankful for what I have and never take things for granted.
			</P>
